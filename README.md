# Tour & Travel Customer Churn Prediction

## General Description
This project aims to assist a Tour & Travel Agency in minimizing customer churn, ultimately saving the company's resources. Customer churn, or the rate at which customers stop using a service, is a critical factor in the travel industry. By predicting potential churners, the agency can take proactive measures to retain valuable customers.

## Key Features
- **Data Visualization:** Gain insights into customer behavior by visualizing data relationships through pair plots, heatmaps, count plots, and box plots.
- **Model Selection:** Enhance predictive accuracy by employing various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
- **Model Tuning:** Optimize model performance using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
- **API Deployment:** Create a user-friendly API with Flask, making it accessible for predictions.
- **Azure Deployment:** Deploy the API on Azure for easy online access.

## Project Overview
This project explores customer churn prediction in the Tour & Travel industry. We leverage machine learning techniques and data analysis to understand customer behavior and predict churn. The final model, based on KNN, offers accurate predictions to help the agency retain customers effectively.
